Implement a set ADT for string keys based on hash tables with linear collision resolution (private hashing).
Generic operations for creating, destroying, clearing, inserting, and deleting keys should be supported.
determining the presence of a key in the set. The implementation of set-theoretic operations is not required.
Rows should be copied into the tree on insertion and destroyed correctly. Create a test program
activating the implementation of all operations.
