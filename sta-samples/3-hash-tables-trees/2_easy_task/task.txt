Using as a base a dynamic structure of tree nodes with pointers to the parent, the left child node
and the right sibling node, implement the basic operations of a tree ADT with string labels.
The implementation should contain typical creation operations,
destruction, ROOT, NODE_LABEL, PARENT, LEFTMOST_CHILD, RIGHT_SIBLING, and forward, backward, and symmetric traversal.
Rows should be copied into the tree on insertion and destroyed correctly.
Create a test program that activates the implementation of all operations.
