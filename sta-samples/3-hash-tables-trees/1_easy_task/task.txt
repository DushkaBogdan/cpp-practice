Using the basic structure in the form of an array of labels and an array of parent indices, implement the main
ADT operations “tree” labeled as strings. The implementation should contain typical creation operations,
destruction, ROOT, NODE_LABEL, PARENT, LEFTMOST_CHILD, RIGHT_SIBLING, and forward, backward, and symmetric traversal.
Rows should be copied into the tree on insertion and destroyed correctly. Create a test program
activating the implementation of all operations.
