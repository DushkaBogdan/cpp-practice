Using the basic structure in the form based on an array of labels and lists of child nodes,
implement the basic operations of a tree ADT with labels as strings. Implementation should
contain typical operations of creation, destruction, ROOT, NODE_LABEL, PARENT, LEFTMOST_CHILD, RIGHT_SIBLING,
as well as forward, backward, and symmetrical bypass. Rows should be copied into the tree on insertion and destroyed correctly.
Create a test program that activates the implementation of all operations.
