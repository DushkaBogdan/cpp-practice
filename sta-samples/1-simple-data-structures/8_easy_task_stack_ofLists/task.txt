1. The user enters into the program through the console a sequence of positive integers,
terminating the input with zero or a negative number. Next, enter one non-negative number,
representing the position of interest P, and another sequence of positive numbers,
terminated by zero or a negative number. Should paste the contents of the second entered sequence
to the first one starting from position P, and then print the resulting sequence. Output order
numbers must match the original input order.

           Input example:
       1 2 3 4 5 0
       2<Enter>
       6 7 8 0 <Enter>

           Sample output:
       1 2 6 7 8 3 4 5

2. Implement a "stack" ADT based on a fixed size array for elements that are singly linked lists
integers (i.e., a stack of lists). When lists are placed on the stack, they must be correctly copied. When removed
lists from the stack - correctly destroyed.
