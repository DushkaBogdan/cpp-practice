The disk file, the path to which is passed as the first argument to the line command, contains lines with arbitrary text.
Write a program that reads lines from a specified file and outputs the following sequence at the end
longest lines, in the order they appear in the file. Explanation:
• let the next line extracted from the file contain N characters, and all previous lines contain less than N characters
• if among the following lines there are no such, the length of which is equal to or greater than N, then this single line will be displayed at the end of the program
• if among the following lines there are those whose length is equal to N, but there are no lines with a length greater than N, at the end of the program all lines with a length of N will be displayed
• if among the following lines there is a line, the length of which is M, with M > N, you should take the value of M as the new N and apply similar criteria to all other lines in the file
