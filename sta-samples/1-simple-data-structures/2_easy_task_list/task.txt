1. The user enters into the program through the console a sequence of positive integers, terminating the input with zero or a negative number.
The program traverses the entered data from beginning to end. If the input sequence contains a subsequence,
consisting of 3 or more elements, which are arranged in ascending order, the program displays the given subsequence in its entirety separated by a space on a separate line.
The program tries to find ordered subsequences of as long as possible. Further analysis begins with an element that violates the previous derived subsequence.

           Input example:
               1 2 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 8 9 10 11 0 <Enter>

           Sample output:
               5 6 7
1 2 3 4
       8 9 10 11

2. Implement the structure, operations, and test program for a singly linked list of strings.
The implementation should not make assumptions about the storage time of the strings passed as arguments, respectively,
the contents of rows should be correctly copied and then deallocated when they are no longer needed.
