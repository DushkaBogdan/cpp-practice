Option number 5:

1. The user enters a sequence of numbers into the program through the console. Each number starts on a new line.
If the number is positive, it is stored in memory. If the number is negative, the last entered number is deleted.
from memory. If there is nothing to delete, an error message is displayed and typing continues. If the number is 0,
the sequence ends. After each input operation, the program displays the current content on the screen.
the accumulated sequence separated by a space on a separate line.

           Input example:
       1<Enter>
       2<Enter>
       3<Enter>
      -1<Enter>
       0<Enter>

           Sample output:
       one
       12
       1 2 3
       12

2. Implement a "queue" ADT based on circular arrays for elements that are arrays
real numbers double, passed as a pair of arguments - a pointer to the beginning of the array + number
elements. Arrays of different lengths can be placed in the queue. You don't need to copy arrays,
you can count on the fact that the external environment will not destroy the blocks in which the arrays are stored,
before they exit the queue.
