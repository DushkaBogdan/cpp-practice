In two disk files, the path to which is passed as the first and second command line arguments, respectively,
contains records of transfers to bank accounts, one record per line in text format:

<NUMBER_FROM_DIGITS> <SUM_REAL_NUMBER>

The third command line argument contains the name of the resulting file into which the program should
record the union of the first two, while payments to the same accounts must be presented
once by the sum of all combined. The program should report error situations,
such as problems opening files or incorrect format.
