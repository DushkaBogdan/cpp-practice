1. The user enters into the program through the console a sequence of positive integers,
terminating the input with zero or a negative number. Next, the user enters a positive number P,
denoting an existing position in the input sequence. The program displays all
sequence values ​​after P, in reverse order, followed by the value in cell P,
followed by all the values ​​before P in direct order.

           Input example:
       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 <Enter>
       4<Enter>

           Sample output:
       9 8 7 6 5 1 2 3 4

2. Implement a stack ADT based on vectors for elements - complex numbers:

      struct Complex
      {
          float m_real, m_imaginary;
      };

It is assumed that all functions that provide the operation of the stack will take instances as arguments
Complex structures, not individual components.
