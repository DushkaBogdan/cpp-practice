1. The user enters into the program through the console a sequence of integers of arbitrary length,
ending the input by pressing the key combination Ctrl + Z. After 5 numbers are entered into the program,
for each new input number, the program displays the elements of the input sequence from the very beginning
one at a time while maintaining the original order.

           Input example:
       1<Enter>
       2<Enter>
       3<Enter>
       4<Enter>
       5<Enter>
       6<Enter>
       7<Enter>
       8<Enter>
       9<Enter>
       <Ctrl+Z> <Enter>

           Sample output:
       1 // after entering the number 6
       2
       3
       4

2. Make additional improvements to the vector implementation of integers:
o provide a function to reserve space in the vector for future elements to avoid unnecessary allocations:

   void IntegerVectorReserve( IntegerVector & _v, int _nCells );

o Provide a function to reduce the size of the allocated block to the size needed to store the values ​​already entered:

   void IntegerVectorShrinkToFit( IntegerVector & _v );

o Provide a function that returns the number of cells available for insertion until the next growth of the vector:

   int IntegerVectorRemainingCapacity ( const IntegerVector & _v );
