1. The user enters into the program through the console a sequence of positive integers, terminating the input with zero or a negative number.
The user then enters a non-negative number representing the position of P in the sequence.
The program displays on separate lines, firstly, all numbers less than or equal to the number in position P, and secondly, all numbers greater than P.
The order of the output numbers must match the original input order. If position P does not exist, the program prints an appropriate error message.
           
           Input example:
       4 2 3 7 5 1 8 9 6 0 <Enter>
       4<Enter>

           Sample output:
       4 2 3 5 1
       7 8 9 6

2. Implement the structure, operations, and test program for a dynamically growing array (vector) of strings.
An implementation must not make assumptions about the lifetime of strings passed as arguments,
accordingly, the contents of strings should be correctly copied and then deallocated when they are no longer needed.
