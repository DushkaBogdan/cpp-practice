1. The user enters into the program through the console a sequence of positive integers,
terminating the input with zero or a negative number. Next, two non-negative numbers are entered - the position P
and number N. It should be removed from the entered sequence of N numbers, starting from position P,
and output the remaining numbers in the sequence. If the position P does not exist or the number N is less than 1,
display appropriate error messages. If starting from position P there are less than N numbers,
remove all elements from position P to the end of the sequence.
The order of the output numbers must match the original input order.

           Input example:
       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 <Enter>
       4 3 <Enter>

           Sample output:
       1 2 3 4 8 9

2. Develop an implementation and a test program that implements a doubly linked list with all operations.
