1. The user enters into the program through the console a sequence of positive integers,
terminating the input with zero or a negative number. Then the user in a loop enters some numbers,
signifying positions P. For each number entered, the program outputs a value from the one entered at the beginning
sequence corresponding to position P. If position does not exist, the program prints an error message
and continues to work. The program ends with Ctrl+Z
Input example:
       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 <Enter>
       5 7 2 <Ctrl+Z> <Enter>

           Sample output:
       6 8 3

2. Implement a queue ADT based on singly linked lists for elements that are instances of the following structure:

       structPoint3D
       {
           float m_x, m_y, m_z;
       };

It is assumed that all functions that provide the operation of the queue will take instances as arguments
Point3D structures, not individual components.
