1. The user enters a sequence of integers into the program through the console. Each number starts with a new
lines. If the number is positive, it is stored in memory. If the number -1 is entered, the program displays
the current state of the input sequence. If the number -2 is entered, the program removes the most
the earliest of the entered numbers stored in memory. If there is nothing to delete, the program displays an error message
and continues typing. Entering the number 0 means the end of the input sequence and exit from the program.

           Input example:
       1<Enter>
       2<Enter>
       3<Enter>
      -1<Enter>
      -2 <Enter>
      -1<Enter>
       0<Enter>

           Sample output:
       1 2 3
       2 3

2. Implement a queue ADT based on a singly linked list for elements that are vectors of integers
(i.e., a queue of vectors). When placed in the queue, the vectors must be copied correctly, and when removed
from the queue after processing - correctly destroyed.
