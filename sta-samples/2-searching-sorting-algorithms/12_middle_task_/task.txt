In a restaurant during the working day for all visitors, the time of arrival and departure is recorded as a pair of time points.
Some visitors spend more time in the restaurant, some less. As a result of collecting information,
there is an array of variables of the simplest structure:

struct CustomerVisitTime
            {
                short m_startHour, m_startMinute;
                short m_finishHour, m_finishMinute;
            };

It is required to calculate during which of the 30-minute segments of the day the restaurant had the most
the number of concurrent visitors.
