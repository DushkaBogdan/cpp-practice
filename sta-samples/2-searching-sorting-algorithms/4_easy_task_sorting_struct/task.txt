1. The program contains explicitly specified data on the population of all regions of Ukraine
(use any data, it is not necessary to remember the names of all areas and enter real
population data). The user enters into the program through the console a string with the name of the area,
and the program prints out the population of that area. If the entered area is not in memory,
the program prints an appropriate error message on the screen.

2. There is a structure that describes the names and initials of people:

       struct PersonName
       {
           char*m_lastName;
           char m_initials[ 2 ];
       };

          Implement one of the simplest sorting algorithms of your choice (bubble, selection, inserts)
for an array of elements that are objects of this structure. At the same time, the primary criterion for
comparison of two objects should be the surname, and if the surname is equal, the difference in initials.
