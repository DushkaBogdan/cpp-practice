In a text file whose name is passed as the first command line argument,
there is data on the average dollar exchange rate on the interbank currency exchange by day, specified in the following format:

    12/11/2012 8.195
    16/11/2012 8.218
    14/11/2012 8.203

Dates may not be consecutive and are not ordered by date. Then the user enters the date of interest to him,
and the program gives the dollar exchange rate on that day. If the file contains a record of such a date, the program issues
found data directly. If there is no record of such a date in the file, the program finds
the two values ​​closest to this date - one earlier and one later, and gives the rate as an arithmetic mean
between the next two dates. If a date is entered that is earlier or later than all available dates,
The program writes an error message.
