1. The program has explicitly specified data about goods from the store. Each product has its own
a unique code in the range from 1 to 100. The numbers do not have to be in a row, there is also no requirement
about any order. The user enters a positive integer into the program, which means the code,
and the program prints the name of the corresponding item, if one is found. If there is no product with this code,
the program prints an error message. The process is repeated cyclically. If code 0 is entered, the program ends.

2. Modify the merge sort algorithm for an array of integers in such a way that
so that you can control from the outside how a small number of elements are sorted.
A general merge sort algorithm should accept a child algorithm such as bubble sort,
insertions or selections, specified as a function handle. If a null function pointer is passed, the split
should continue to the elementary cases with N=1 or N=2, where no algorithm is required.
Compare the performance of 4 merge modes (lower level basic algorithm, bubble sort,
selection or insertion sort) on the same sufficiently large set of random numbers
(for example, 500,000 items).
