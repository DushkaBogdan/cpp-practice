1. The program contains explicitly specified data on the monthly revenue of the Roga i Kopyta enterprise for
previous year of activity. The user enters the serial number of the month in the year into the program
(January-1, February-2,..., December-12). The program prints the revenue data in the appropriate format for the input.
month number. If an incorrect number is entered, the program prints an appropriate error message.

2. The program generates an array of N random integers. It is necessary to measure and compare performance
two program fragments for different N:
o a large number of M calls to a linear search for a random number in this array;
o launching a quicksort of the array + the same large number of M calls to binary search for a random number in the same array.
