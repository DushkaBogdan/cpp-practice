1. Imagine a small hotel with 20 rooms. Some may be free
some are occupied by guests. Write a program that simulates the registration of information about the guests of the rooms.
Initially, the hotel is empty. If the user enters the number 1, it is followed by a number representing the number
and the program prints whether the given number is busy. If the user enters the number 2, it is also followed by the number
signifying number, and the program makes the free number occupied. If the number was already taken, the program prints
error message. If the user enters the number 3, it is also followed by a number representing the number
and the program releases the busy number. If the number was not busy, the program prints an error message.
The process is repeated cyclically until the number 4 is entered, after which the program ends. In teams 1-3,
if an incorrect number is entered, the program prints an error message.

2. The user enters into the program a sequence of positive integers in an arbitrary order,
terminating the input with zero or a negative number. The program answers the question whether such a permutation exists.
entered numbers so that an arithmetic progression is obtained from the original set.
