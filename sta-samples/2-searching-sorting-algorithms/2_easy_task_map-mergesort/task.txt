1. Implement all ADT operations “mapping”, which uses strings as keys,
and as values - real numbers (double). Implementation should be based on two
separate vectors for keys and values. Lines to be displayed should be copied when pasting,
and when deleting data, rows should be correctly freed.

2. Implement a merge sort algorithm for an array of strings, where the strings must be compared without taking into account
case (i.e., "hello" and "HELLO" should be treated as the same string).
