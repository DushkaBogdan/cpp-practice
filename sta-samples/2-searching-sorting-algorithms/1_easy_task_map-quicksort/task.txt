1. Implement all "mapping" ADT operations for keys and values ​​that are integers,
based on a single vector object. Vector must store both keys and values ​​in internal cells
in one block as a nested structure:

       struct IntegerMap
       {
           int m_nUsed;
           int m_nAllocated;

           struct Cell
           {
               int m_key;
               int m_value;
           };
           Cell*m_pData;
       };

2. Modify the algorithm for quick sorting an array of integers in such a way that
that the reference element (pivot) was selected from three elements of the sorted interval - the first,
middle and last. It is necessary to compare the elements with each other and choose the average value among them.
This technique should reduce the probability of unsuccessful partitions on the reference element.
