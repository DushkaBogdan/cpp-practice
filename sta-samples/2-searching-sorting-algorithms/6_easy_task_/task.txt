1. The user enters text of arbitrary length into the program, completing the input by pressing the key combination <Ctrl+Z>.
The program calculates the length of each input string and collects statistics on the length of the various strings in
display object. The key in the mapping is the length of the string, and the value is the number of strings with that length.
After the input is completed, the program prints the collected statistics on the screen.

2. Implement the simplest sorting algorithm of your choice (bubble, selection, inserts) for the array,
containing pointers to objects-sets of integers. When comparing sets, the first thing to do is
be guided by the minimum value in the set. If these minimum values ​​are equal
for two sets, the set with fewer elements should come first.
