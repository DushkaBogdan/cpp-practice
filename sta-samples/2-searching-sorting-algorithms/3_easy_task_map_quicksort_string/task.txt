1. Implement all "mapping" ADT operations, for keys and values ​​that are integers,
where key duplication is allowed. In other words, one key can correspond to several
values ​​(such a structure is called a “multimap”). Implementation can be based on
separate vectors for keys and values. To the standard set of ADT operations “mapping” follows
add an operation that returns the number of values ​​corresponding to the specified key:

   COUNT_KEY( map, key ) : int

In operations of searching and deleting by key, you should use the first pair that comes across during the traversal
with the given key. If the key corresponds to N values, then to completely remove it
from mappings, the REMOVE_KEY operation must be called exactly N times.

2. Implement a quick sort algorithm for an array of strings, while the strings must be compared
case-insensitive (i.e., "hello" and "HELLO" should be treated as the same string). As a reference
element, use a random position.
