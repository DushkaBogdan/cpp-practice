1. Complete the implementation of the ADT “set” for integers based on singly linked lists with the following operations:

       IS_SUBSET ( set1, set2 ) : bool - returns true if the first set is a subset of the second set.

       EQUAL ( set1, set2 ) : bool - returns true if two sets have the same elements.

MIN_KEY ( set ) : value - Returns the key with the minimum value.

MAX_KEY ( set ) : value - Returns the key with the maximum value.

2. The program has an explicit set of 20 surnames ordered alphabetically.
Surnames may be repeated. The user enters a string representing the last name. The program looks for the entered
last name in the set and prints the number of records with that last name. If no records are found,
the program prints the number 0. A prerequisite is that the program, in the worst case, must do no more than
5 family comparisons!
