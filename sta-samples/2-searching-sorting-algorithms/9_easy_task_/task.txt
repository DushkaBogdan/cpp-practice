1. Implement all ADT “set” operations for string keys based on alphabetically ordered
singly linked lists. Rows placed in a set should be copied on paste,
correctly free on deletion. Verify that the implementation works with a test program.

2. There is an array of elements-points in three-dimensional space:

        structPoint3D
        {
            double m_x, m_y, m_z;
        };

Using any of your favorite sorting algorithms as a basis, write a program that
which sorts the array of points in ascending order of the point's distance from the origin and displays it on the screen.
