Create a hierarchy of classes that model information about a simple football tournament:

• FootballClub class - a club participating in the tournament:
o name;
o city;
o year of foundation;
o rating (integer from 1 to 5);

• Match class - match within the tournament:
o host and guest clubs;
o final score;
o method for manual account entry;
o a method for automatically generating a score in a pseudo-random way, taking into account club ratings (if the club's rating is higher, the probability of winning is higher);

• class TournamentTable - tournament table:
o information about club statistics - the number of points scored (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss), the number of wins, draws, defeats, the number of goals scored and conceded;
o method for updating on the current set of matches;
o a method for printing the table to the passed stream;
o maintaining statistics in sorted order (by points).

• Tournament class (football tournament), including:
o name;
o a fixed number and set of clubs participating in the tournament;
o dynamically growing sequence of matches;
o a method for automatically generating the schedule of matches (all clubs must play against each other 2 times - at the home stadium and away)
o standings - storage and updating at the right time.

Write a test console program that creates and uses the given model:
• create a tournament and teams;
• automatically generate the schedule of matches;
• simulate the results of matches (automatically generate scores);
• print the results of all matches on the console;
• generate and print a detailed tournament table in text form on the console;
• print the name of the club that won the tournament;
• print out the names of the last two clubs;
• correctly destroy all model objects.
